Shedding notes and todos

TODOs:
- WoW pickup
- ff7 pickup

- [x] level builder parse from text
- [x] countdown to next pickup spawn
    - todo make this more visually appealing - an affect on the grid where colors on grid change to represent a countdown
- some of pickups are enemies
- [x] movement animation
- [x] blocked movement animation when move towards a wall
- narrative when something is picked up
- something happens when player picks up all types
- ry moves randomly sometimes?
- experiment with mirror not moving if either is blocked
- [x] animation for pickups to move from ry to their grid position
- tutorial on how to play!? maybe not needed really
- player or ry is not blocked by spawns
    - ry not blocked-in progress, need to make the grid support multiple things
- level progression where pickups spawn in controlled way.
- don't spawn pickups during tutorials

visuals
- ry character gets more fuzzy or hectic as more memories on ground
- handdrawn glowing pickups
- handdrawn grid
- grid in line lights up between ry and i upon moving

other
- [x] javascript

CI
- github action CI
   - https://github.com/abigpotostew/shedding/actions/new/JavaScript

level generation:
- [x] openNeighbors should implement collision. other cannot pass through a pickup
    - got a workable version without collision using lists
- the two paths to pickup should not share a direct neighbor
- spawn rate based on distance to goal from both player and other.

bugs:
- pickup spawn animation delays to show the grid coloring
